This includes tuberculosis screening, vital signs, and a review of medical history.\n4.  **Personal Property Inventory**: All personal belongings are meticulously cataloged, inspected for contraband, and securely stored. Inmates are only permitted state-issued clothing and approved personal hygiene items.\n5.  **Security Risk Assessment & Housing Assignment**: Based on criminal history, gang affiliations, medical needs, and behavior observed during intake, a risk level is assigned, dictating appropriate housing (e.g., general population, protective custody, administrative segregation, medical observation). Assignment must be approved by a Shift Sergeant or higher authority.\n6.  **Initial Orientation**: Inmates receive a copy of the **Inmate Handbook**, outlining rules, rights, grievance procedures, and facility operations. A brief verbal orientation is also provided by a Correctional Officer (CO)."

Common areas, recreation yards, and workshops are subject to daily inspections.\n2.  **Inmate Searches**: All inmates are subject to searches upon entry/exit from the facility, before and after visitation, transport, and at random intervals. Searches include pat-downs, strip searches (conducted by two officers of the same gender in a private area), and K-9 unit searches.\n3.  **Definition**: Contraband includes, but is not limited to: unauthorized weapons (shivs, sharpened objects), illegal narcotics, unauthorized prescription medications, excessive amounts of currency, unauthorized electronic devices (cell phones, recording devices), tools, flammable materials, gang-related symbols, or any item modified to serve an illicit purpose.\n4.  **Seizure & Documentation**: Any contraband discovered must be immediately **seized**, documented via an **Incident Report (IR)**, photographed if possible, and secured in the evidence locker. The IR must detail the item, discovery location, involved parties, and circumstances.\n5.  **Disciplinary Action**: Inmates found in possession of contraband will be placed on **disciplinary report**, facing penalties such as: loss of commissary/visitation privileges, cell restriction, placement in **Solitary Confinement (AdSeg)** pending a disciplinary hearing, and potential criminal prosecution. Repeat offenses escalate penalties significantly."

This triggers an immediate facility-wide alert.\n2.  **Central Command Notification & Containment**: Upon code activation, **Central Command (Control Room)** will initiate a **facility-wide lockdown**, sealing all automated doors and gates in affected and adjacent blocks. Additional personnel establish a secure perimeter.\n3.  **Emergency Response Teams (ERT) Deployment**: \n    * **Initial Response Team**: Available COs and Sergeants closest to the incident for initial containment and assessment, prioritizing safety.\n    * **Tactical Response Unit (TRU)**: Highly trained and equipped team (riot gear, less-lethal weapons) deployed to engage and neutralize the disturbance, regain control, separate combatants, secure weapons, and rescue injured personnel/inmates.\n    * **Medical Emergency Response**: Paramedics and medical staff staged safely, ready to provide immediate medical attention once the area is secured.\n4.  **Inmate Account & Welfare Check**: After the disturbance is quelled and the area is secure, a thorough **inmate count** is conducted.

The list is subject to change based on availability and security reviews.\n3.  **Fund Management**: Funds for commissary purchases are drawn directly from the inmate's trust account. Inmates cannot possess cash; funds are deposited by inmates or their approved contacts.\n4.  **Order Processing & Delivery**: Submitted order forms are reviewed by a designated CO for accuracy, fund availability, and compliance with limits. Orders are then processed by commissary staff. Deliveries are typically made **within 48-72 hours** of the order being placed, supervised by Correctional Officers. Inmates must sign for their delivered items.\n5.  **Restrictions & Privileges**: Commissary access is a privilege, not a right. Inmates on disciplinary segregation or with outstanding infractions may have their commissary privileges suspended or restricted based on misconduct severity. Over-ordering, attempts to purchase prohibited items, or illicit transactions will result in immediate suspension of privileges and disciplinary action."

Many minor issues can be resolved at this level.\n2.  **Formal Grievance Form (Step 2)**: If informal resolution is unsuccessful, or for more serious concerns, an inmate may request a **Grievance Form**. These forms must be filled out completely, detailing the nature of the grievance, date of incident, involved parties, and desired resolution. Forms are typically available from COs or in the law library.\n3.  **Submission & Initial Review**: Completed grievance forms are to be submitted to a designated **Grievance Officer** (often a Lieutenant or specially assigned non-security staff member) within **72 hours** of the incident. The Grievance Officer reviews the form for completeness and determines if it falls within the scope of the grievance policy.\n4.  **Investigation & Response**: Valid grievances trigger an internal investigation. This may involve interviewing the inmate, staff, and witnesses, reviewing documentation, and examining facility procedures. A written response to the grievance, outlining the findings and resolution, will be provided to the inmate within **15 business days**.\n5.  **Appeal Process (Step 3)**: If the inmate is dissatisfied with the initial response, they have the right to **appeal** the decision to a higher authority (e.g., Captain of the Guard, or the Warden's administrative assistant) within **5 business days** of receiving the initial response. The appeal will prompt a further review. The decision at the appeal level is generally final within the institution."
